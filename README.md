# PLP-COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker
__________________________________
Goal: Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.

✅ Tasks:

Plot total cases over time for selected countries.

Plot total deaths over time.

Compare daily new cases between countries.

Calculate the death rate: total_deaths / total_cases.

✅ Visualizations:

Line charts (cases & deaths over time).

Bar charts (top countries by total cases).

Heatmaps (optional for correlation analysis).

✅ Tools:

matplotlib

seaborn

5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress

Goal: Analyze vaccination rollouts.

✅ Tasks:

Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.

Compare % vaccinated population.

✅ Charts:

Line charts.

Optional: Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.

✅ Tools:

matplotlib

seaborn

6️⃣ Optional: Build a Choropleth Map

Goal: Visualize cases or vaccination rates by country on a world map.

✅ Tools:

Plotly Express

Or geopandas (advanced)

✅ Tasks:

Prepare a dataframe with iso_code, total_cases for the latest date.

Plot a choropleth showing case density or vaccination rates.

7️⃣ Insights & Reporting

Goal: Summarize findings.

✅ Tasks:

Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").

Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.

Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write your narrative.

✅ Deliverables:

A well-documented Jupyter Notebook combining:

Code

Visualizations

Narrative explanations

Optional export: Notebook → PDF or a PowerPoint with screenshots.

🛠️ Recommended Tools:

✅ Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
✅ pandas
✅ matplotlib & seaborn
✅ Optional: plotly, geopandas
